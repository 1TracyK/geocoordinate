    <description>GeoCoordinate is a portable class library (in v1.1.x) or netstandard v1.1 (from v2.x.x) implementation of System.Device.Location.GeoCoordinate. It is an exact 1:1 API compliant implementation and will be supported until MSFT sees it fit to embed the type. Which at that point this implementation will cease development/support and you will be able to simply remove this package and everything will still work.</description>
